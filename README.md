## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anabel Cortez, and I'm a full-stack web developer with JavaScript and Node.js as my favourite technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  Harry Potter Journal web app, which allows users to explore Harry Potter books, read chapter summaries, and journal their thoughts. It utilizes both a public API for book data and a private API that I built to manage user interactions. Check it out -> git@github.com:Acortezm/projects.git
  <!--
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate, where I'm learning The fundamental concepts, key terms, building blocks, and applications of AI, encompassing generative AI. How to build generative AI-powered apps and chatbots using various programming frameworks and AI technologies. How to use Python and Flask to develop and deploy AI applications on the web
   It would be good to reference some code work.-->
